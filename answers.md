Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

First, I learned what Express was. Express is like React for the backend. It sits on top of Node.js and adds functionality. Second, I learned how to write custom middleware with Express.

Describe Middleware?

Middleware is a function that gets a request and response object and can return the response or send it to the next middleware function. You can use middleware to route your application or perform other tasks.

Describe a Resource?

What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
